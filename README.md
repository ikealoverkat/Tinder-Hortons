# Tinder-Hortons
Tinder Hortons is our submission for the .JPEG Hackathon! Writing by Ari and Keerthi, art by Zhiqing, &amp; coding by Kat!! Made with Ren'Py :D

Raccoon Dating Sim: You're a worker in a local Tim Hortons, and suddenly the store is infested by raccoons. Your toxic boss tasks you to try and date the raccoons, and because you need money to pay your rent, you (reluctantly) agree.

Play the web game from itch.io & try to go through all the different dialogue options! We put a lot of effort into the writing!

Have fun!
